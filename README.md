An idea to digitalize electoral!
I would like to present an idea before you which is based upon the concept of blockchain technology implementing in digital voting poll booth (process).

A Week before the Electoral(Election to be occured) an information stating voter's Name, and his/her Reference id number(which is encrpyted by Election Commission) is circulated among list of eligible persons (age>18)to vote through their respective registered mobile number .

Now coming to the Voting poll which is a digital process , first we need to make sure of the person's identity is secured by a facial recognition(cannot be changed after once recognised ). Secondly, in the voter id a barcode is placed which displays the person's information when scanned. 

The Site is opened after scanning, which displays a number of fields where each field holds information such as 'candidates name' standing on their respective places and their representing 'party's symbol' also a last column which stands for the person(voter) whether to vote or not for the respective candidate(this column is enabled only by the user). 

Once the person casts his/her vote to a candidate who represented some party. This count is now added to the fellow candidate under their respective party since the teller(scrutineers) are 'methods' called for each vote casted .In the back-end, a Virtual memory as a Block is created upon which holds the information of person who has casted his/her vote along with pointer points to the next Reference id .Thus, a cob-web of network(randomly connected but sorted through 'ref no') is created upon the server controlled by the Election Commission.

Suppose if a block tends to be vulnerable(i.e. hypothetical),Unlike the linked list concept which holds ony two nodes connected by a pointer from one node to another , this block-chain technology of binding each block to any other block/block's stands polished like honey-comb technology.

I'm sure we all are aware of the security of the block-chain technology which was created in 2008 which is indestructible as on date.

Again we would face some issues such as recipients to be controlled by the servers of Election Commissions would be large-scale 
so we should make sure of selected time frame is issued for certain regions so that it would handle the issue.

Also a question would rise upon what happens if a reload or an Exit(or Shutdown) happens unexpectedly. The answer to this question lies with the user the submission of the web-form is to be redone.

The unseen issue rised is the turnout rate per year for such a person to cast his/her first vote has to register before unless they are unable to cast their vote.
